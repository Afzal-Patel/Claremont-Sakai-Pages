If you have recently added or dropped a course, have waited for one of the three automatic update periods, and are still unable to access your expected course site(s), please contact your <a href="../Policies/supportContact.html" target="_blank"><strong>college's IT department</strong></a>.</li><br>
            <li class="tab3">
                If you are not yet officially registered for the course, your instructor must add you to the course with an "Auditor" role. Otherwise, you will be removed automatically by Sakai due to your official membership status. Once your membership is updated by the Registrar's office, your role will automatically change from "Auditor" to "Student".
