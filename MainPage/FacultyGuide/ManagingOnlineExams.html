        <div class="container1"><div class="boxText"> Administering tests online can be more challenging than in a traditional classroom. Here are some observations for a successful delivery of online tests to our students using the Claremont Sakai System. Remind your students to read through the <a href="../StudentGuide/TestTakingGudelines.html" target="_blank">Test Taking Guidelines</a> prior to taking every assessment.</div> </div>

        <ul class="listFormat">

            <li><h2>Implement One Question Per Page<br></h2>
                <ul><li class="tab3">Use the default question layout setting where each question is on a separate web page. This setting allows for a student's work to be saved before moving on to the next page of the test. Claremont Sakai automatically saves a student's work every 5 minutes by default, but through the default setting it will save more often and therefore reduce the potential loss of student work due to any unexpected events. It also takes less time to load one question per page. After creating the assessment with the <a href="https://sakai.claremont.edu/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=howdoicreateanassessmentintestsandquizzes" target="_blank">assessment builder</a> or with <a href="https://sakai.claremont.edu/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=howdoicreateanewassessmentusingmarkuptextorcutandpaste" target="_blank">copy/paste and markup text</a>, access the settings menu and select the first option under <em>Layout and Appearance: Question Layout</em>. </li><li><br><br><img src="../../images/managing/one%20question%20per%20page.png" alt="This image displays the Layout and Appearance menu under test and quiz settings. Highlighted is the default option to adjust the assessment so that only one question is displayed per page." class="adjustToScreen"><br><br></li></ul></li>

            <li><h2>Give Students a Sufficient Amount of Time<br></h2>
                <ul><li class="tab3">Students may have very different internet connectivities depending on their regions and time of day. If possible, please <strong>avoid</strong> the midnight due date. Many tests have this due date setting, and the high volume of system usage may impact studentsâ€™ submission procedures.<br><br></li> 
                    <li><img src="../../images/managing/test%20time.png" alt="This image displays the Availability and Submissions menu under test and quiz settings. Highlighted are the options to configure assessment release date, due date, and time allotment for students." class="adjustToScreen">
                    <br><br></li>
                    <li class="tab3">For students requiring accommodations for different time limits and due dates, exceptions can be made through <em>Exceptions to Time and Delivery Date</em>.<br><br></li>
                    <li><img src="../../images/managing/text%20exception.png" alt="This image displays the Exceptions to Time Limit and Delivery Date menu under test and quiz settings. Highlighted is the option add time limit and release date exceptions for particular students."  class="adjustToScreen"><br><br></li></ul></li>

            <li><h2>Practice Assessments<br></h2>
                <ul><li class="tab3">Offer a practice test or quiz to your students so they can have a chance to become familiar with the process of accessing, taking, and submitting different types of assessments and questions before attempting the actual versions.<br></li></ul></li>

            <li><h2>Academic Integrity<br></h2>
                <ul><li class="tab3">Have your students electronically sign the school or department honor pledge for academic integrity before beginning the assessment.<br><br></li>
                    <li><img src="../../images/managing/honor%20code.png" alt="This image displays the About this Assessment menu under test and quiz settings. Highlighted is the option to require students to agree to the honor pledge before beginning the assessment." class="adjustToScreen"><br><br></li>
                    </ul></li>

            <li><h2>Grading<br></h2>
                <ul><li class="tab3">The commercial GradeScope is a tool already integrated within Sakai and can be used in your course site for grading. Anonymous grading is also available.<br></li>
                    <li class="tab3"> Unless preferred, you should not immediately release scores to Gradebook. Instead, wait until a specified date to share feedback with your students.<br><br></li>
                    <li><img src="../../images/managing/grading.png" alt="This image displays the Grading and Feedback menu under test and quiz settings. Highlighted are the options to send scores immediately to students or to delay sending feedback back until a specified date to students upon test completion." class="adjustToScreen">
