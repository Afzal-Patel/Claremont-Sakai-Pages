Students and faculty cannot access the future course sites at this point. If access is required prior to the population date, their college's Sakai admin can help provide that access.<br><br></li> 

                    <li><sup><strong>**</strong></sup> Course sites are populated two weeks before classes begin. Add/Drop scripts that update information run three times per day during the semester. When a student drops a course, their account is made inactive within the course site. However, the student is not actually deleted or removed from the site to ensure that any work that has already been submitted is retained.<br><br></li>

                    <li><sup><strong>***</strong></sup> Two weeks after grades are due, course sites will be unpublished . At this point, the faculty can still access the course sites but the students cannot. For details regarding republishing, see <a href="PolicyCourseSites.html">course sites</a>.</li>

                    <li><br>Project sites are not affected. For more information see the <a href="Retention.html">Course Site Retention Policy</a>.<br><br></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>As with any personal account, users must not share their username and password with anyone. All users are responsible for all material originating from their account and for complying with relevant University policies including <a href="http://copyright.claremont.edu/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.html" target="_blank">the Claremont Colleges copyright policy</a> and each school&apos; accessibility policy. LMS users login with their college network credentials. Your LMS account will be available as long as you can log into your college&apos;s network resources.</li>
                    <h3><br>Creation</h3>
                    <li class="tab3">The creation of an LMS account is based on the registrar&apos;s information as well as your individual college&apos;s IT department&apos;s decision.<br></li> 

                    <h3>Removal</h3>
                    <li class="tab3"> If your college network credentials are deactivated, your LMS account will no longer be accessible.<br></li>


                    <h3>Storage Quota</h3>
                    <li class="tab3">
                        Files uploaded into Sakai Resources have a 100 mb file size limit. Storage services such as Box are recommended for uploading multimedia, and they can be shared through Sakai Resources. Any user needing more than the standard LMS site quota may make a special request to their <a href="supportContact.html" target="_blank">IT service desk</a> for a quota increase. Each IT department will make a judgment on whether to grant the quota increase request and how much it should be increased.
